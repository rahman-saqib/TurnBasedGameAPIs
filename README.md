# Intoduction

In this session, you learn how to build a multiplayer, turn-based game using Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).

Amazon DynamoDB is a fully-managed, NoSQL database that provides lightning-fast performance at any scale.

Amazon SNS is a high-volume messaging service that allows for pub/sub functionality as well as messaging directly to SMS, email, or mobile applications.

## Why use both Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon SNS for a game application?

Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon SNS are common choices for use in game applications. Both services provide high-scalability with ease of use and straight-forward pricing.

Some of the key reasons to use Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon SNS for your game application are:

‚Ä¢ Performance: Amazon DynamoDB provides single-digit millisecond latency at any scale.

‚Ä¢ Pay-per-use: Both Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon SNS offer pay-per-use pricing models. This eases development and ensures your bill only grows as your user base does.

‚Ä¢ Fully-managed: Both Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon SNS do not require you to provision servers, perform upgrades, or handle failovers. All operations are managed by AWS, allowing you to focus on building your application.

# 1. Background and Setup
Imagine you are building an online application where users can play Nim, a turn-based strategy game. In Nim, there are three heaps of objects. Two players alternate turns removing any number of objects from a single pile. The goal of the game is to force the other player to remove the last object.

As part of your application, you need to save the state of an existing game. You also need to notify users at various points in a game. You notify them when a user invites them to a new game, when it is their turn to play, and when a winner has been decided.

## Step 1a: Create an AWS account
Use a personal AWS account or create a new AWS account for this lab. Do not use an organizational account so that you have full access to the necessary services and do not leave behind any resources. If you do not delete the resources when you are finished, **you may incur AWS charges**.

## Step 1b: Set up your AWS Cloud9 IDE
To set up your AWS Cloud9 development environment:

Navigate to the AWS Management Console, choose Services at the top of the page, and then choose Cloud9 under Developer Tools.
- Choose Create environment.
- Type Turn-based game in the Name box. Leave the Description box empty.
- Choose Next step.
- Leave the Environment settings at their defaults to create a new t2.micro EC2 instance, which will be hibernated after 30 minutes of inactivity.
- Choose Next step.
- Review the environment name and settings, and choose Create environment. Your environment will be provisioned and prepared after several minutes.
- When the environment is ready, your IDE should open with a welcome note.


You should now see your AWS Cloud9 environment. You need to be familiar with the three areas of the AWS Cloud9 console shown in the following screenshot:

- File explorer: On the left side of the IDE, the file explorer shows a list of the files in your directory.
- File editor: On the upper right area of the IDE, the file editor is where you view and edit files that you‚Äôve selected in the file explorer.
- Terminal: On the lower right area of the IDE, this is where you run commands to execute code samples.
![alt text](https://d1.awsstatic.com/Getting%20Started/AWS-Labs-Turn-Based-Game/turn-based-game-cloud9.a8b55e4797f1a0dc1a7f55da0cfb94065fb2bbad.png)

## Step 1c: Download the supporting code
In this, you use JavaScript to interact with your Amazon DynamoDB database and Amazon SNS. Run the following commands in your AWS Cloud9 terminal to download and unpack the module code.

```
cd ~/environment 
git clone https://github.com/rahman-saqib/TurnBasedGameAPIs.git .
```

Run the following command in your AWS Cloud9 terminal to view your directories.

```
ls
```



You should see two directories in the AWS Cloud9 file explorer:

**Application**: The application directory contains example code for the turn-based game application. This code is similar to the code you would have in your real turn-based game application backend.

**Scripts**: The scripts directory contains administrator-level scripts, such as for creating AWS resources or loading data into your database.

Run the following command in your AWS Cloud9 terminal to install the dependencies for both directories.

```
npm install --prefix scripts/ && npm install --prefix application
```
Run the following command in your AWS Cloud9 terminal to set your AWS Region in an environment file. This example uses us-east-1, but enter your AWS Region of choice to use for the lab. 

```
echo "export AWS_REGION=us-east-1" >> env.sh && source env.sh
```

You use the **env.sh** file to store environment variables of resources and other parameters you need in this lab. If you take a break during this lab and then start a new session in your AWS Cloud9 environment, be sure to reload your environment variables by executing the following command in your terminal:

```
source env.sh
```

[üè† Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)



# 2. Provision a database

In this module, you provision an Amazon DynamoDB database and learn how to use DynamoDB to store information about your turn-based game. 

Amazon DynamoDB is a fully-managed NoSQL database provided by AWS. It provides single-digit millisecond response times and near-infinite scalability. DynamoDB is used by a wide variety of applications and industries, from the Amazon.com shopping cart to Lyft‚Äôs geolocation service to a wide variety of online games.

All interaction with DynamoDB is done over HTTPS using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for authentication and authorization. Usually, you use the AWS SDK for your language of choice to interact with DynamoDB. If you are using AWS compute options for your application, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) or AWS Lambda, your application can use the AWS credentials in your compute environment to make requests to DynamoDB.

## Step 2a: Provision an Amazon DynamoDB database

First, let‚Äôs provision a DynamoDB database. A database in DynamoDB is also called a table.

When creating a DynamoDB table, you need to specify the attribute(s) that will make up the primary key of your table. Each record you write to your DynamoDB table is called an item, and each item must include the primary key of your table.

DynamoDB data modeling and primary key design is an important topic. However, your game has a simple access pattern that does not require advanced data modeling.

In your application, you use DynamoDB as a simple key-value store. Each game has a *gameId* attribute that uniquely identifies each game. The *gameId* attribute is used as the primary key for your table.

In the **scripts/** directory, there is a file called **create-table.sh** that creates your DynamoDB table using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). The contents of the file are as follows:

```
aws dynamodb create-table \
  --table-name turn-based-game \
  --attribute-definitions '[
    {
      "AttributeName": "gameId",
      "AttributeType": "S"
    }
  ]' \
  --key-schema '[
    {
      "AttributeName": "gameId",
      "KeyType": "HASH"
    }
  ]' \
  --provisioned-throughput '{
    "ReadCapacityUnits": 5,
    "WriteCapacityUnits": 5
  }'
  ```

First, it gives the table a name *turn-based-game*. Then, it declares the attributes that are used in the table‚Äôs primary key. You are using a simple primary key in this example, so you only declare a single attribute, gameId, which is of a string data type. Next, you specify your primary key schema by stating that the *gameId* attribute be used as your table‚Äôs hash key.

Finally, you specify the number of read and write capacity units you want for your table. DynamoDB does have an on-demand pricing mode where you pay for each read and write request against your table. However, the provisioned throughput mode fits within the AWS Free Tier, so you can use that here.

Create your table by running the following command in your terminal:

```
bash scripts/create-table.sh
```

You should see the following output in your terminal:

```
{
    "TableDescription": {
        "AttributeDefinitions": [
            {
                "AttributeName": "gameId",
                "AttributeType": "S"
            }
        ],
        "TableName": "turn-based-game",
        "KeySchema": [
            {
                "AttributeName": "gameId",
                "KeyType": "HASH"
            }
        ],
        "TableStatus": "CREATING",
        "CreationDateTime": 1574086642.07,
        "ProvisionedThroughput": {
            "NumberOfDecreasesToday": 0,
            "ReadCapacityUnits": 5,
            "WriteCapacityUnits": 5
        },
        "TableSizeBytes": 0,
        "ItemCount": 0,
        "TableArn": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:955617200811:table/turn-based-game",
        "TableId": "c62cb86a-211e-4a50-a160-4a616c8f3445"
    }
}
```

## Step 2b:  Save an example game item in your table

Now that you have created your table, you can add items to your table. Each game is represented by a single item in the table.

The schema of each game item is as follows:


![alt text](https://d1.awsstatic.com/Getting%20Started/AWS-Labs-Turn-Based-Game/turn-based-game-schema.e4cd3826657521e17bd481d2063d8ecd5cf7fe48.png)

Each game includes a **GameId**, which is a unique identifier for the game. The attributes *User1* and *User2* store the usernames of the two users that are playing the game. The attributes *Heap1*, *Heap2*, and *Heap3* store the number of objects in each of the three heaps. Finally, the *LastMoveBy* attribute indicates the player who made the most recent move.

In the scripts/ directory, there is a createGame.js file that adds an example game to your table. The contents of the file are as follows:

```
const AWS = require('aws-sdk')
const documentClient = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient()

const params = {
  TableName: 'turn-based-game',
  Item: {
    gameId: '5b5ee7d8',
    user1: 'myfirstuser',
    user2: 'theseconduser',
    heap1: 5,
    heap2: 4,
    heap3: 5,
    lastMoveBy: 'myfirstuser'
  }
}

documentClient.put(params).promise()
  .then(() => console.log('Game added successfully!'))
  .catch((error) => console.log('Error adding game', error))
```

You import the AWS SDK and then create an instance of the DynamoDB Document Client. The Document Client is a higher-level abstraction over the low-level DynamoDB API and makes it easier to work with DynamoDB items. After creating the client, the script assembles the parameters for a **PutItem** API call, including the table name and the attributes on the item. Then it calls the **put()** method on the Document Client and logs out information on success or failure.

You can run the script to insert a game into your table by running the following command in your terminal:

```
node scripts/createGame.js
```

You should see the following output in your terminal:

``
Game added successfully!
``

**Note**: If you run the command too quickly, you may get an error that the table is not yet available. Wait one minute, then try the command again.

Great! You have now added a single game to your table. In the next step, you learn how to update that game item to simulate a user making a move.

## Step 2c: Update a game item in your table

Now that you have a game item in your table, you can learn how to simulate a player making a move for a game that‚Äôs in progress.

There are two ways you could handle this operation. In the first way, you retrieve the item using the **GetItem** API. Then, you update the game item in your application according to the move made by the player. Finally, you replace the existing item in DynamoDB using the **PutItem** API. Although this option works, it requires multiple requests to your DynamoDB table and risks overwriting any changes that happened between fetching and re-writing your game item.

The second way to handle this operation is to use the **UpdateItem** API call in DynamoDB. With the **UpdateItem** API, you can update your DynamoDB item in place via a single request. You specify the item you want changed, the attributes to change, and any conditions to want to assert on the item. This is the preferred way to make a change to an item because it doesn't require multiple calls to your database.

In the **scripts/** directory, there is a file called **performMove.js** which has the following contents:

```
const AWS = require('aws-sdk')
const documentClient = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient()

const performMove = async ({ gameId, user, changedHeap, changedHeapValue }) => {
  if (changedHeapValue < 0 ) {
    throw new Error('Cannot set heap value below 0')
  }
  const params = {
    TableName: 'turn-based-game',
    Key: { 
      gameId: gameId
    },
    UpdateExpression: `SET lastMoveBy = :user, ${changedHeap} = :changedHeapValue`,
    ConditionExpression: `(user1 = :user OR user2 = :user) AND lastMoveBy <> :user AND ${changedHeap} > :changedHeapValue`,
    ExpressionAttributeValues: {
      ':user': user,
      ':changedHeapValue': changedHeapValue,
    },
    ReturnValues: 'ALL_NEW'
  }
  try {
    const resp = await documentClient.update(params).promise()
    console.log('Updated game: ', resp.Attributes)
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('Error updating item: ', error.message)
  }
}

performMove({ gameId: '5b5ee7d8', user: 'theseconduser', changedHeap: 'heap1', changedHeapValue: 3 })
```

This script is a little complicated, so let‚Äôs take it step-by-step.

Like the previous script, you import the AWS SDK and create a DynamoDB Document Client instance.

Then, you define a method called **performMove**. This method is similar to an internal method that would be used in your application when a user requests to make a move. The script assembles the parameters for an **UpdateItem** API call. First, it changes two attributes on the game -- the last user to make a move, and the number of elements in the changed heap.

The UpdateItem API parameters then make some assertions about the current state of the game. The ConditionExpression is evaluated before the item is updated to confirm that the item is in the state you want. You are making the following three assertions in your condition expression:

  1. That the user requesting to perform a move is one of the two users in the game;
  2. That the current turn belongs to the user requesting to perform the move;
  3. That the heap being changed has a current value higher than the value to which is it being changed.

Finally, the parameters state a **ReturnValue** of **ALL_NEW**, which means that DynamoDB returns the entire item after its values have been updated. Once you have this, your application can evaluate the game to see if there‚Äôs a winner.

At the bottom of the file is an example of how this method is called in your application. You can execute the script with the following command:

```
node scripts/performMove.js
```

You should see the following output in your terminal:

```
Updated game:  { heap2: 4,
  heap1: 3,
  heap3: 5,
  gameId: '5b5ee7d8',
  user2: 'theseconduser',
  user1: 'myfirstuser',
  lastMoveBy: 'theseconduser' }
```

You can see that the write was successful and the game has been updated.

Try running the script again in your terminal. You should see the following output:

``
Error updating item:  The conditional request failed
``

Your conditional requests failed this time. The requesting user -- *theseconduser* -- was the most recent player to move. Further, the changed heap -- *heap1* -- already had a value of 3, meaning the user didn‚Äôt change anything. Because of this, the request was rejected.

# 3. Set up notifications with Amazon SNS

When building a turn-based game, you need some way to contact your users to notify them of important events. This includes alerting them that a new game is started, notifying them that it is their turn to play, or informing them that a game has ended.

In this module, you use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to notify your users. Amazon SNS is a fully-managed messaging system that allows for pub/sub functionality as well as direct messaging to SMS and email.

Amazon SNS has pay-per-use pricing, so you are only billed for the messages you send. You don‚Äôt need to provision throughput ahead of time.

## Step 3a: Send SMS messages via Amazon SNS

There are two different ways to use Amazon SNS. The first way is to create a topic and publish messages to it. You can then configure multiple subscribers to the topic, and each subscriber receives a copy of a message when it is published. This approach is using Amazon SNS in a pub/sub manner and is commonly used for broadcasting messages between services in a microservices architecture.

The second way to use Amazon SNS is to publish messages directly to a consumer. This method is the approach used in this module. Amazon SNS allows you to publish directly to an SMS number for simple text messaging.

In the **scripts/** directory, there is a **sendMessage.js** file. The contents of that file are as follows:


```
const AWS = require('aws-sdk')
const sns = new AWS.SNS();

const sendMessage = async ({ phoneNumber, message }) => {
  const params = {
    Message: message,
    PhoneNumber: phoneNumber
  }

  return sns.publish(params).promise()
}

sendMessage({ phoneNumber: process.env.PHONE_NUMBER, message: 'Sending a message from SNS!'})
  .then(() => console.log('Sent message successfully'))
  .catch((error) => console.log('Error sending SNS: ', error.message))
```

Like in the DynamoDB module, you are importing the AWS SDK for JavaScript in Node.js and creating a client for the service you are using.

There is a **sendMessage** function that is similar to a function you have in your application. It takes a phone number and message, and it publishes it as an SMS message.

At the bottom of the file is an example invocation of that message. You can test this out in your console.

First, export your phone number as an environment variable. You need to include the country code in the number. If you are in the United States, that country code is **1**.

Use the following command to save and export your phone number, substituting your number for the default listed:

```
echo "export PHONE_NUMBER=+15555555555" >> env.sh && source env.sh
```

Next, execute the **sendMessage.js** script by entering the following command in your terminal:

```
node scripts/sendMessage.js
```

You should see the following output in your terminal:

``
Sent message successfully
``

You should also receive a message on your phone.

![alt text](https://d1.awsstatic.com/Getting%20Started/AWS-Labs-Turn-Based-Game/turn-based-game-sms.e68686bcc577495147e4d76ea904b509078d70b5.png)

Success! You were able to send a message via Amazon SNS. You use Amazon SNS to notify your users of a number of events in your turn-based game. 

[üè† Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

# 4. Add authentication to your application

In this module, you configure Amazon Cognito for use as the authentication provider in your application. Amazon Cognito is a fully managed authentication provider that allows for user sign-up, verification, login, and more.

Amazon Cognito has two different components: *user pools* and *identity pools*. User pools are standard user directories where users sign in through Amazon Cognito or through a third-party identity, such as Google or GitHub. After successful authentication, users receive tokens, such as access tokens or ID tokens, that can be used to access resources in the backend.

In contrast, identity pools provide a way for users to receive temporary AWS credentials for accessing AWS resources. This could be used to provide limited, direct access to an AWS Lambda function, an Amazon DynamoDB table, or other resources.

In this tutorial, you use Amazon Cognito user pools. You allow users to register via your application. After they‚Äôve registered, they can login via a client to receive an ID token. This ID token can be passed as a header to your application to authenticate the user.

In the following steps below, you create an Amazon Cognito user pool. Then you create a client to access the user pool. Finally, you look at some example code to interact with the user pool.

## Step 4a: Create an Amazon Cognito user pool

A *user pool* is a user directory -- all user and group management happens in your pool. When creating a user pool, you need to specify rules for your user pool, including your password policy and the required attributes.

By default, Amazon Cognito includes a number of standard attributes that are not required by your user. In your application, you want the *phone_number* attribute to be a required attribute because users are notified via SMS message. Thus, when creating your user pool, mark phone_number as required.

In the **scripts/** directory, there is a file called **create-user-pool.sh.** The contents are as follows:

```
USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cognito-idp create-user-pool \
  --pool-name turn-based-users \
  --policies '
      {
        "PasswordPolicy": {
          "MinimumLength": 8,
          "RequireUppercase": true,
          "RequireLowercase": true,
          "RequireNumbers": true,
          "RequireSymbols": false
        }
      }' \
  --schema '[
      {
        "Name": "phone_number",
        "StringAttributeConstraints": {
            "MinLength": "0",
            "MaxLength": "2048"
        },
        "DeveloperOnlyAttribute": false,
        "Required": true,
        "AttributeDataType": "String",
        "Mutable": true
      }
  ]' \
  --query 'UserPool.Id' \
  --output text)

echo "User Pool created with id ${USER_POOL_ID}"
echo "export USER_POOL_ID=${USER_POOL_ID}" >> env.sh
```

This script uses the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to create a user pool. You give your user pool a name -- *turn-based-users* -- and specify your password policies. For the password, this script requires a minimum length of eight characters, and the password must include an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, and a number.

Additionally, you specify in your schema that the *phone_number* attribute is a required attribute for all users, as this is needed for notifying your users of important game events. 

You can create your user pool by executing the script with the following command:

```
bash scripts/create-user-pool.sh
```

You should see the following output:

```
User Pool created with id <user-pool-id>
```

In the next step, you create a client to access the user pool.

## Step 4b: Create a user pool client

Now that you have a user pool configured, you need to make a *user pool client*. A user pool client is used to call unauthenticated methods on the user pool, such as register and sign in.

The user pool client is used by your backend Node.js application. To register or sign in, a user makes an HTTP POST request to your application containing the relevant properties. Your application uses the user pool client and forwards these properties to your Amazon Cognito user pool. Then, your application returns the proper data or error message.

There is a file in the **scripts/** directory called **create-user-pool-client.sh** for creating a user pool client. The contents of the file are as follows:

```
source env.sh

CLIENT_ID=$(aws cognito-idp create-user-pool-client \
  --user-pool-id ${USER_POOL_ID} \
  --client-name turn-based-backend \
  --no-generate-secret \
  --explicit-auth-flows ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH \
  --query 'UserPoolClient.ClientId' \
  --output text)

echo "User Pool Client created with id ${CLIENT_ID}"
echo "export COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=${CLIENT_ID}" >> env.sh
```

The script creates a user pool client for your newly-created user pool. It uses the **ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH** flow, which is a flow that can be used in a server-side application. Because you‚Äôre doing a server-side flow, you don‚Äôt need a client secret used in a client-side flow, such as on a mobile device or in a single-page application.

Run the script to create the user pool client with the following command:

```
bash scripts/create-user-pool-client.sh
```

You should see the following output:

```
User Pool Client created with id <client-id>
```

In the last step of this module, you learn about the authentication code that is used in your application.

## Step 4c: Review authentication code

Now that you have created a user pool and a client to access the pool, let‚Äôs see how you use Amazon Cognito in your application.

In the **application/** directory of your project, there is a file called **auth.js**. This file contains a few authentication helpers for your application. There are four core functions to that file. Let‚Äôs review them in turn.

The first function is **createCognitoUser** and is used when registering a new user in Amazon Cognito. The function looks as follows:

```
const createCognitoUser = async (username, password, email, phoneNumber) => {
  const signUpParams = {
    ClientId: process.env.COGNITO_CLIENT_ID,
    Username: username,
    Password: password,
    UserAttributes: [
      {
        Name: 'email',
        Value: email
      },
      {
        Name: 'phone_number',
        Value: phoneNumber
      }
    ]
  }
  await cognitoidentityserviceprovider.signUp(signUpParams).promise()
  const confirmParams = {
    UserPoolId: process.env.USER_POOL_ID,
    Username: username
  }
  await cognitoidentityserviceprovider.adminConfirmSignUp(confirmParams).promise()
  return {
    username,
    email,
    phoneNumber
  }
}
```

It uses the Amazon Cognito client ID that you set in the previous step, as well as the username, password, email, and phone number given by the user, to create a new user. Additionally, you immediately confirm the user so that the user can sign in. Usually, you opt for a confirmation process that verified the user‚Äôs email and/or mobile phone number so that you have a contact method for them. That‚Äôs out of scope for this tutorial, so you can just automatically confirm new users.

The second core method is the login function that is used when registered users are authenticating. The code is as shown below:

```
const login = async (username, password) => {
  const params = {
    ClientId: process.env.COGNITO_CLIENT_ID,
    UserPoolId: process.env.USER_POOL_ID,
    AuthFlow: 'ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH',
    AuthParameters: {
      USERNAME: username,
      PASSWORD: password
    }
  }
  const { AuthenticationResult: { IdToken: idToken } }= await cognitoidentityserviceprovider.adminInitiateAuth(params).promise()
  return idToken
}
```

Like in the **createCognitoUser** function, you use the Client Id and the given parameters to make a call to Amazon Cognito. The **adminInitiateAuth** method for Amazon Cognito authenticates the user and return tokens if the authentication method passes. You use ID tokens for authentication, so that is what you return for successful user logins.

The third function is **fetchUserByUsername**. You use this function to fetch a user object by a given username to find the phone number for a user you need to notify. The code is as follows:

```
const fetchUserByUsername = async username => {
  const params = {
    UserPoolId: process.env.USER_POOL_ID,
    Username: username
  };
  const user = await cognitoidentityserviceprovider.adminGetUser(params).promise();
  const phoneNumber = user.UserAttributes.filter(attribute => attribute.Name === "phone_number")[0].Value;
  return {
    username,
    phoneNumber
  };
};
```

The function takes a single parameter, username. It then calls the **adminGetUser** function from the Amazon Cognito client. Then, it filters through the attributes to find the user‚Äôs phone number and returns an object with the user‚Äôs username and phone number.

Finally, there is a **verifyToken** function. The contents of this function are as follows:

```
const verifyToken = async (idToken) => {
  function getKey(header, callback){
    client.getSigningKey(header.kid, function(err, key) {
      var signingKey = key.publicKey || key.rsaPublicKey;
      callback(null, signingKey);
    });
  }

  return new Promise((res, rej) => {
    jwt.verify(idToken, getKey, {}, function(err, decoded) {
      if (err) { rej(err) }
      res(decoded)
    })
  })
}
```

This function verifies an ID token that has been passed up with a request. The ID token given by Amazon Cognito is a JSON Web Token, and the **verifyToken** function confirms that the token was signed by your trusted source and to identify the user. This function is used in endpoints that require authentication to ensure that the requesting user has access.

In subsequent modules, you use these four authentication functions in your backend application.

# 5. Deploy your application to AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway

In this module, you deploy your application code to AWS Lambda, a serverless computing service. With AWS Lambda, you don‚Äôt need to worry about server management or capacity planning. You simply upload the code you want to run, and AWS runs the code whenever a configured event trigger occurs.

One of the event triggers you can use with Lambda is Amazon API Gateway. Amazon API Gateway lets you configure HTTP endpoints that forward requests to your AWS Lambda functions. Between Lambda and API Gateway, you can build a fully functioning web application without provisioning or managing any servers. Further, both Lambda and API Gateway are billed on a pay-per-use basis, meaning you only pay for what you use.

In the following steps, you walk through setting up a Lambda function and configuring HTTP routes with API Gateway using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). If you are building an application using Lambda and API Gateway, use a tool such as AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) or the Serverless Framework to manage your serverless applications using infrastructure-as-code.

## Step 5a: Packaging your code and deploying it to Lambda

First, you need to package up your function code and deploy it to AWS Lambda. Lambda expects you to upload a ZIP file containing all of your application code. Additionally, you specify a runtime to use and the file and function that serves as the entry point to your code. This entry point is called a *handler* and is called whenever an incoming event triggers your code.

In addition to the function code, you also need to provide an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role for your Lambda function. This role is assumed by your function upon execution so that it has permissions to access AWS resources, such as reading or writing from a database, sending messages to a queue, or logging output to Amazon CloudWatch.

In the **scripts/** directory, there is a file called **create-lambda.sh**. This script does four things:

   1. Zips up the contents of the **application/** directory for use in your Lambda function.
   2. Creates an IAM role to be assumed by your Lambda function.
   3. Adds an IAM policy to your IAM role that allows your Lambda function to access your DynamoDB table and publish messages to Amazon SNS.
   4. Creates the Lambda function by uploading your zip file.

If you want to see the AWS CLI commands used to run these steps, open the **scripts/create-lambda.sh** file in your file explorer.

To execute the script, run the following command in your terminal:

```
bash scripts/create-lambda.sh
```

You should see the following output:

```
$ bash scripts/create-lambda.sh
Building zip file
Creating IAM role
Adding policy to IAM role
Sleeping for IAM role propagation
Creating Lambda function
Lambda function created with ARN <functionArn>
```

## Step 5b: Creating and configuring an API Gateway REST API

Now that you have deployed your Lambda function, you can make it accessible over HTTP using Amazon API Gateway. API Gateway provides a powerful access layer to your backend services. It is highly configurable and provides for authentication, validation, rate-limiting, and more.

In your **scripts/** directory, there is a file called **create-rest-api.sh** that provisions an API Gateway REST API and connects it to your Lambda function. This script handles a number of things, including:

   1. Creates a REST API in API Gateway.
   2. Configures a proxy resource and method in the REST API to send all incoming request paths and methods to a single Lambda function.
   3. Adds the permissions for the REST API to trigger your Lambda function.

API Gateway has a lot of configuration options, and this tutorial cannot cover all of the details. For additional detail, see Amazon API Gateway Concepts.

Run the following command in your terminal to execute the script and configure your REST API:

```
bash scripts/create-rest-api.sh
```

You should see the following output in your terminal:

```
Creating REST API
Fetching root resource
Creating proxy resource
Creating method
Adding integration
Creating deployment
Fetching account ID
Adding lambda permission
REST API created

Your API is available at: https://<id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/prod
```

You‚Äôve now configured your REST API to connect to your Lambda function. The end of the output included the base URL to access your REST API.

The value of your base URL was added to the env.sh file. Source that file now to set the BASE_URL environment variable in your terminal.

```
source env.sh
```

## Step 5c: Testing your API endpoint

Now that your API is live, let‚Äôs test it out. You‚Äôll walk through a quick explanation of the code before testing one of your endpoints.

The web application is built using Express.js, a popular Node.js web application framework. You don‚Äôt need to use an existing web framework like Express.js when building applications on AWS Lambda, but it can ease the learning curve if you have experience with Express.

The core of the Express application is located in **application/app.js.** Open the file in the file explorer.

```
// application/app.js
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const { createGame, fetchGame, performMove, handlePostMoveNotification } = require("./data");
const {
  createCognitoUser,
  login,
  fetchUserByUsername,
  verifyToken
} = require("./auth");
const { validateCreateUser, validateCreateGame, validatePerformMove } = require("./validate");

const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.json());

function wrapAsync(fn) {
  return function(req, res, next) {
    fn(req, res, next).catch(next);
  };
}

// Login
app.post("/login", wrapAsync(async (req, res) => {
  const idToken = await login(req.body.username, req.body.password);
  res.json({ idToken });
}));

// Create user
app.post("/users", wrapAsync(async (req, res) => {
  const validated = validateCreateUser(req.body);
  if (!validated.valid) {
    throw new Error(validated.message);
  }
  const user = await createCognitoUser(
    req.body.username,
    req.body.password,
    req.body.email,
    req.body.phoneNumber
  );
  res.json(user);
}));

// Create new game
app.post("/games", wrapAsync(async (req, res) => {
  const validated = validateCreateGame(req.body);
  if (!validated.valid) {
    throw new Error(validated.message);
  }
  const token = await verifyToken(req.header("Authorization"));
  const opponent = await fetchUserByUsername(req.body.opponent);
  const game = await createGame({
    creator: token["cognito:username"],
    opponent: opponent
  });
  res.json(game);
}));

// Fetch game
app.get("/games/:gameId", wrapAsync(async (req, res) => {
  const game = await fetchGame(req.params.gameId);
  res.json(game);
}));

// Perform move
app.post("/games/:gameId", wrapAsync(async (req, res) => {
  const validated = validatePerformMove(req.body);
  if (!validated.valid) {
    throw new Error(validated.message);
  }
  const token = await verifyToken(req.header("Authorization"));
  const game = await performMove({
    gameId: req.params.gameId,
    user: token["cognito:username"],
    changedHeap: req.body.changedHeap,
    changedHeapValue: req.body.changedHeapValue
  });
  let opponentUsername
  if (game.user1 !== game.lastMoveBy) {
    opponentUsername = game.user1
  } else {
    opponentUsername = game.user2
  }
  const opponent = await fetchUserByUsername(opponentUsername);
  const mover = {
    username: token['cognito:username'],
    phoneNumber: token['phone_number']
  }
  await handlePostMoveNotification({ game, mover, opponent })
  res.json(game);
}));

app.use(function(error, req, res, next) {
  res.status(400).json({ message: error.message });
});

module.exports = app;
```

At the top of this file, you import express and other dependencies, including the authentication helper functions and data access functions that you reviewed in previous modules. Then, you configure the various routes you want in your function, such as **/login** for a user to login and fetch an ID token or **/games/:gameId** to fetch the status of a particular game. Finally, at the bottom of the file, the script exports the Express application.

Next, look at **application/handler.js.** This is the file with the entrypoint method that you tell Lambda to invoke on an incoming request. The contents of this file are as follows:

```
// application/handler.js
const awsServerlessExpress = require('aws-serverless-express')
const app = require('./app')
const server = awsServerlessExpress.createServer(app)

exports.handler = (event, context) => { awsServerlessExpress.proxy(server, event, context) }
```

This handler is using the aws-serverless-express package. This package converts an incoming API Gateway request into the standard request expected by the Express.js framework. This makes it easy to run Express.js code using Lambda and API Gateway.

Let‚Äôs test your endpoint by fetching the game you created in an earlier module. This request goes through API Gateway to your Lambda function, which then makes a request to DynamoDB and returns the results.

Run the following command in your terminal:

```
curl -X GET ${BASE_URL}/games/5b5ee7d8
```

You should see the following output in your terminal:

```
{"heap2":4,"heap1":3,"heap3":5,"gameId":"5b5ee7d8","user2":"theseconduser","user1":"myfirstuser","lastMoveBy":"theseconduser"}
```

Success! You hit your API endpoint. This triggered your Lambda function, which retrieved the game details for your requested game from DynamoDB.

[üè† Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)


# 6. Test your application

In this module, you use your application that you‚Äôve deployed. Before you do that, let‚Äôs do a quick recap of the AWS components you‚Äôre using in your application:

   ‚Ä¢ Amazon DynamoDB for data storage, including the AWS SDK for JavaScript in Node.js with IAM authentication to read and write data to your database.
   ‚Ä¢ Amazon SNS for SMS messaging to alert your users of important events in the game.
   ‚Ä¢ Amazon Cognito for user registration and authentication.
   ‚Ä¢ AWS Lambda for compute.
   ‚Ä¢ Amazon API Gateway for HTTP-based access to your Lambda function.

Let‚Äôs see how each of these pieces tie together. In the following steps, you walk through your different application endpoints using these components.

First, you start with a **Registration** endpoint, where a new user signs up and creates their account.

Second, you use a **Login** endpoint where a user can use a client (such as a web application or a mobile app) to authenticate and receive an ID token.

Third, you use a **CreateGame** endpoint to create a new game between two users.

Fourth, you use the **FetchGame** endpoint to retrieve the current state of a game for display in a browser.

Finally, you use the **PerformMove** endpoint to simulate users makig moves and to trigger SMS messages.

## Step 6a: Register a new user

The first workflow you review is the **Registration** endpoint. At this endpoint, a new user signs up by providing login information, like username and password.

You create two users in this step so that you can simulate the two users alternating moves in a game of Nim. 

As you look at these endpoints, the relevant snippets of code that are invoked by the endpoint are shown in this guide.

Your registration endpoint is available by making a POST request to the **/users** endpoint. You can see the logic for this endpoint in the **application/app.js** file about halfway down:

```
// Create user
app.post("/users", wrapAsync(async (req, res) => {
  const validated = validateCreateUser(req.body);
  if (!validated.valid) {
    throw new Error(validated.message);
  }
  const user = await createCognitoUser(
    req.body.username,
    req.body.password,
    req.body.email,
    req.body.phoneNumber
  );
  res.json(user);
}));
```

Your handler takes the request payload and validates that it has the required properties. If all required properties are present, it creates a new user in Amazon Cognito.

You already reviewed the **createCognitoUser** function in the Amazon Cognito module, so we won‚Äôt recap it here.

Try invoking your **Registration** endpoint to create a new user. Run the following command in your terminal:

```
curl -X POST ${BASE_URL}/users \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
	"username": "myfirstuser",
	"password": "Password1",
	"phoneNumber": "'${PHONE_NUMBER}'",
	"email": "test@email.com"
}'
```

You should see the following output in your terminal:

```
{"username":"myfirstuser","email":"test@email.com","phoneNumber":"+15555555555"}
```

Great! You‚Äôve successfully created your user. Now, create a second user so that you can simulate playing a game.

Run the following command in your terminal:

```
curl -X POST ${BASE_URL}/users \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
	"username": "theseconduser",
	"password": "Password1",
	"phoneNumber": "'${PHONE_NUMBER}'",
	"email": "test@email.com"
}'
```

You should see the following output in your terminal:

```
{"username":"theseconduser","email":"test@email.com","phoneNumber":"+15555555555"}
```

Now, let‚Äôs log in and receive an ID token for each of the two users.

## Step 6b: Login to fetch user credentials

Your second endpoint is the **Login** endpoint. Users submit their username and password to this endpoint to receive an ID token, which is used to authenticate them on subsequent requests.

To handle this authentication and token dispensing, your application has a **/login** endpoint. The handler is in **application/app.js** as follows:

```
// Login
app.post('/login', wrapAsync(async (req, res) => {
  const idToken = await login(req.body.username, req.body.password)
  res.json({ idToken })
}))
```

It expects the payload body to have *username* and *password* properties. It then calls your helper **login** function from your **auth.js** file. If the login is successful, it returns the ID token for the user.

Let‚Äôs test it out with your first created user. Run the following command in your terminal:

```
curl -X POST ${BASE_URL}/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
	"username": "myfirstuser",
	"password": "Password1"
}'
```

You should see a response with an **idToken** property in your terminal:

```
{"idToken":"eyJraWQiO‚Ä¶."}
```

This ID Token is used in subsequent requests to authorize a user. Save the value of the ID token in your shell by copying the value of the token between the quotations, then running the following command:

```
export FIRST_ID_TOKEN=<idToken>
```

Do the same steps to login with your second user. Execute the following command in your terminal:

```
curl -X POST ${BASE_URL}/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
	"username": "theseconduser",
	"password": "Password1"
}'
```
You should see a response with an **idToken** property in your terminal:

```
{"idToken":"eyJraWQiOiI...."}
```

Again, copy the quoted value of the ID token and save it as an environment variable with the following command:

```
export SECOND_ID_TOKEN=<idToken>
```

**Note:** These identity tokens are temporary credentials that will expire over time. If you return to this tutorial after a period of time, you may need to re-run the steps above to generate new tokens.

## Step 6c: Create a new game


Now that your user has a way to authenticate, let‚Äôs create a new game. This happens in the browser for your application, as the user chooses to create a new game and enters the username of their opponent.

The endpoint for creating a new game is **POST /games**, and the handler code in **application/app.js** is as follows:

```
// Create new game
app.post("/games", wrapAsync(async (req, res) => {
  const validated = validateCreateGame(req.body);
  if (!validated.valid) {
    throw new Error(validated.message);
  }
  const token = await verifyToken(req.header("Authorization"));
  const opponent = await fetchUserByUsername(req.body.opponent);
  const game = await createGame({
    creator: token["cognito:username"],
    opponent: opponent
  });
  res.json(game);
}));
```

This code is doing a few things. First, it validates that the incoming payload is in the proper format and contains all required fields. Then, it verifies the ID token that is sent over in the Authorization header. If this token is valid, it then fetches details about the second user using the **fetchUserByUsername** function in the **auth.js** script that you reviewed in a previous module. Finally, it creates a new game by passing the username of the creator and the opponent details into the **createGame** function.

The **createGame** function is in **application/data/createGame.js** and looks as follows:

```
const AWS = require("aws-sdk");
const documentClient = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient();
const uuidv4 = require("uuid/v4");
const sendMessage = require("./sendMessage");

const createGame = async ({ creator, opponent }) => {
  const params = {
    TableName: "turn-based-game",
    Item: {
      gameId: uuidv4().split('-')[0],
      user1: creator,
      user2: opponent.username,
      heap1: 5,
      heap2: 4,
      heap3: 5,
      lastMoveBy: creator
    }
  };

  try {
    await documentClient.put(params).promise();
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("Error creating game: ", error.message);
    throw new Error("Could not create game");
  }

  const message = `Hi ${opponent.username}. Your friend ${creator} has invited you to a new game! Your game ID is ${params.Item.gameId}`;
  try {
    await sendMessage({ phoneNumber: opponent.phoneNumber, message });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("Error sending message: ", error.message);
    throw new Error("Could not send message to user");
  }

  return params.Item;
};

module.exports = createGame;
```

The **createGame** function generates a unique game id and saves the basic game details into DynamoDB. Then, it sends a message to the opponent to alert them that a new game has started and it is their turn to play.

Let‚Äôs try using this endpoint. Run the following command in your terminal:

```
curl -X POST ${BASE_URL}/games \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: ${FIRST_ID_TOKEN}" \
  -d '{
	"opponent": "theseconduser"
}'
```

Note that you‚Äôre passing the ID token of the first user in the Authorization header with your request.

You should see the following output in your terminal:

```
{"gameId":"433334d0","user1":"myfirstuser","user2":"theseconduser","heap1":5,"heap2":4,"heap3":5,"lastMoveBy":"myfirstuser"}
```

A new game has been created! You should receive an SMS message on the phone number you registered for the second user.

![alt text](https://d1.awsstatic.com/Getting%20Started/AWS-Labs-Turn-Based-Game/turn-based-game-new-game.20be251453a716777063e561cb95abc0738677ce.jpg)


Save the value of the game Id to your terminal using the following command:

(Make sure you substitute the value of your game Id for <*yourGameId*>
	
```
export GAME_ID=<yourGameId>
```
	

Try running this endpoint again but without an ID token. Run the following command in your terminal: 

```
curl -X POST ${BASE_URL}/games \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
	"opponent": "theseconduser"
}'
```

Because your request does not include a token, you should see the following output:

```
{"message":"jwt must be provided"}
```
	
You have used your Amazon Cognito tokens to protect an endpoint.

## Step 6d: Fetch the status of a game


In this step, you can fetch the details for a particular game. This can be used in your application when a user checks their in-progress games or wants to make a move in a game.

The endpoint to fetch a game is **GET /games/:gameId**, and the handler code is contained in **application/app.js** as follows:

```
// Fetch game
app.get("/games/:gameId", wrapAsync(async (req, res) => {
  const game = await fetchGame(req.params.gameId);
  res.json(game);
}));
```

This endpoint is not an authenticated endpoint as each user can see in-progress games if desired.

Invoke the endpoint and fetch the game by entering the following command in your terminal:

```
curl -X GET ${BASE_URL}/games/${GAME_ID}
```

You should see the following output in your terminal:

```
{"heap2":4,"heap1":5,"heap3":5,"gameId":"32597bd8","user2":"theseconduser","user1":"myfirstuser","lastMoveBy":"myfirstuser"}
```

Success! You retrieved the game, and it has the details such as the number of objects in each heap and the users involved in the game.

In the next step, you perform moves in the game.

## Step 6e: Perform moves in a game


In this final step, you simulate users performing moves in a game. This happens from your application client, such as a web browser, where users select and submit a potential move.

The endpoint to fetch a user is **POST /games/:gameId**. The handler code is contained in **application/app.js** as follows:

```
// Perform move
app.post("/games/:gameId", wrapAsync(async (req, res) => {
  const validated = validatePerformMove(req.body);
  if (!validated.valid) {
    throw new Error(validated.message);
  }
  const token = await verifyToken(req.header("Authorization"));
  const game = await performMove({
    gameId: req.params.gameId,
    user: token["cognito:username"],
    changedHeap: req.body.changedHeap,
    changedHeapValue: req.body.changedHeapValue
  });
  let opponentUsername
  if (game.user1 !== game.lastMoveBy) {
    opponentUsername = game.user1
  } else {
    opponentUsername = game.user2
  }
  const opponent = await fetchUserByUsername(opponentUsername);
  const mover = {
    username: token['cognito:username'],
    phoneNumber: token['phone_number']
  }
  await handlePostMoveNotification({ game, mover, opponent })
  res.json(game);
}));
```

The handler does a number of things. First, it validates that the request payload matches the required shape. If the payload shape passes validation, it then verifies the given Authorization header to identify the user requesting the game. After verification, it then attempts to perform a move using the **performMove** function. This function is similar to the performMove function in the DynamoDB module, as it performs an **UpdateItem API** call with all of the conditions needed.

After the move is successfully performed, your application then needs to send any post-move notifications. It first fetches the opponent by username to get the phone number for the user. Then, it passes the game, mover, and opponent into the **handlePostMoveNotification** method. That method is shown below:

```
const sendMessage = require('./sendMessage')

const handlePostMoveNotification = async ({ game, mover, opponent }) => {
  // Handle when game is finished
  if (game.heap1 == 0 && game.heap2 == 0 && game.heap3 == 0) {
    const winnerMessage = `You beat ${mover.username} in a game of Nim!`
    const loserMessage = `Ahh, you lost to ${opponent.username} in Nim.`
    await Promise.all([
      sendMessage({ phoneNumber: opponent.phoneNumber, message: winnerMessage }),
      sendMessage({ phoneNumber: mover.phoneNumber, message: loserMessage })
    ])

    return
  }

  const message = `${mover.username} has moved. It's your turn next in Game ID ${game.gameId}!`
  await sendMessage({ phoneNumber: opponent.phoneNumber, message })
};

module.exports = handlePostMoveNotification;
```

The **handlePostMoveNotification** first checks to see if the game is over because all heaps are empty. If so, it sends winning and losing notifications to the respective users. If the game is not over, it then notifies the opponent that it is their turn to play.

Try performing a move with the following command:

```
curl -X POST ${BASE_URL}/games/${GAME_ID} \
  -H "Authorization: ${SECOND_ID_TOKEN}" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
	"changedHeap": "heap1",
	"changedHeapValue": 0
}'
```

Note that it is the second user making this request -- as indicated by usage of the **SECOND_ID_TOKEN** for authorization -- and that the user is setting the value of *heap1* to **0**.

You should see the following results in your terminal:

```
{"heap2":4,"heap1":0,"heap3":5,"gameId":"32597bd8","user2":"theseconduser","user1":"myfirstuser","lastMoveBy":"theseconduser"}
```

The response includes the current state of the game and indicates that heap1 now has 0 elements, and that the last move was by *theseconduser*.

You should have also received a notification for the first user that it‚Äôs their turn to move.
turn-based-game-second-user

![alt text](https://d1.awsstatic.com/Getting%20Started/AWS-Labs-Turn-Based-Game/turn-based-game-second-user.94b85839e5fbbc86ff30f1252ab458a2d480a59c.jpg)

Let‚Äôs simulate the end of a game by making two more moves.

First, have the first user remove all the items in heap 2 by running the following command:

```
curl -X POST ${BASE_URL}/games/${GAME_ID} \
  -H "Authorization: ${FIRST_ID_TOKEN}" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
	"changedHeap": "heap2",
	"changedHeapValue": 0
}'
```

You should see the following output in your terminal:

```
{"heap2":0,"heap1":0,"heap3":5,"gameId":"32597bd8","user2":"theseconduser","user1":"myfirstuser","lastMoveBy":"myfirstuser"}
```

Finally, have the second user remove all the objects from the third pile, which ends the game:

```
curl -X POST ${BASE_URL}/games/${GAME_ID} \
  -H "Authorization: ${SECOND_ID_TOKEN}" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
	"changedHeap": "heap3",
	"changedHeapValue": 0
}'
```

You should see the following output in your terminal:

```
{"heap2":0,"heap1":0,"heap3":0,"gameId":"32597bd8","user2":"theseconduser","user1":"myfirstuser","lastMoveBy":"theseconduser"}
```

This ends the game, which triggers the end-of-game notifications for both users.

This screen capture shows the notification for both users, as both users were configured to use the same phone number.

# 7. Clean up and next steps

In the previous steps, you built a turn-based game with notifications to alert users. To build this game, you used:

   ‚Ä¢ Amazon DynamoDB and for state storage
   
   ‚Ä¢ Amazon SNS for SMS messaging
   
   ‚Ä¢ Amazon Cognito for user authentication
   
   ‚Ä¢ AWS Lambda for compute
   
   ‚Ä¢ Amazon API Gateway for HTTP routing

These tools provide flexible, high-scale solutions to many problems you face when building high-traffic game applications.

In the following steps, you clean up the resources you created in this lab.
